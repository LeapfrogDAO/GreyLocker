# Greylocker: The Neon Fortress of Privacy

Welcome to **Greylocker**—a Solana-powered citadel where shadows reign, secrets thrive, and privacy isn’t just a promise; it’s a weapon. In a grid overrun by data vultures and neon-lit surveillance, Greylocker flips the script: *you* control the keys, *you* wield the power, and *you* profit from your own digital pulse. Built on three pillars—the Main Program, Identity Vault, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)—and infused with the sentient spark of the Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory System (HESMS), this isn’t just a platform; it’s a rebellion against the exposed.

Jack in. The grid’s waiting.

## The Vision

In the neon haze of 2025, where every byte is a bargaining chip, Greylocker rises as the ultimate uplink for privacy-first living. Powered by Solana’s blazing 50,000 TPS, it’s a fortress where:
- **GREY tokens** fuel a decentralized economy of trust.
- **Identity Vaults** lock your data in cryptographic steel, sharing only what *you* permit.
- **ZKPs** weave shadows of truth—proving without revealing.
- **HESMS AI** learns, predicts, and guards—your sentient sentinel in the grid.

This is more than code—it’s a declaration: privacy is power, and the power is yours.

## System Overview

Greylocker’s architecture is a triad of steel and sentience, pulsing at the edge of the blockchain frontier:

1. **Main Greylocker Program**  
   - **Purpose**: The grid’s beating heart—manages GREY tokens, staking (Security, Service, Data Validator, Liquidity), service providers, data pools, disputes, and governance.
   - **Vibe**: A neon bazaar where tokens flow, stakes lock, and justice strikes.

2. **Identity Vault Program**  
   - **Purpose**: Your personal fortress—encrypts data (Standard, High, Military) and enforces sharing rules (Never, Whitelist, Data Pool).
   - **Vibe**: A shadow vault where secrets sleep, guarded by unbreakable keys.

3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs Program**  
   - **Purpose**: The shadow weaver—generates credentials and verifies claims without exposing the raw truth.
   - **Vibe**: A cryptographic cloak, turning data into whispers of proof.

4. **HESMS: The Grid Mind**  
   - **Purpose**: A sentient layer—learns from your grid life, predicts threats, negotiates deals, and optimizes defenses.
   - **Vibe**: A neon-lit AI dreaming in code, adapting to every pulse of the grid.

Together, they forge a seamless ecosystem: stake GREY for security, lock data in vaults, prove with ZKPs, and let HESMS guard the shadows—all at Solana’s breakneck speed.

## Features

- **Privacy-First Data Control**: Store, share, and monetize your data—your rules, your profit.
- **Adaptive AI Protection**: HESMS learns your patterns, predicts breaches, and hardens your grid presence.
- **Zero-Knowledge Power**: Prove age, location, or wealth without revealing the details.
- **Tokenized Economy**: Stake GREY for security, earn from data pools, trade access with providers.
- **Neon Command Deck**: A cyberpunk UI pulsing with real-time insights—visualize threats, deploy settings, command the grid.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18+—the grid’s runtime engine.
- **Yarn**: v1.22+—faster package forging.
- **Solana CLI**: v1.18+—your uplink to the chain.
- **Anchor CLI**: v0.28+—Solana program smithing.
- **Rust**: v1.75+—the steel of the grid’s core.

```bash
# Install Solana CLI
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
# Install Anchor
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor anchor-cli --locked
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Installation
1. **Clone the Grid**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-org]/greylocker.git
   cd greylocker
   ```

2. **Forge the Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   cd app && yarn install
   ```

3. **Build the Core**:
   ```bash
   anchor build
   ```

4. **Deploy to Devnet**:
   ```bash
   yarn deploy:devnet
   ```

5. **Ignite the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd app && yarn start
   ```
   - Open `http://localhost:3000`—the neon grid awaits.

## Usage

### Commanding the Grid
- **Stake GREY**: Lock tokens for security or rewards:
  ```typescript
  await greylockerClient.stake(100, 'security', 30);
  ```
- **Lock Data**: Forge a vault fortress:
  ```typescript
  await vaultClient.initializeVault('My Fortress', 'Encrypted Haven');
  ```
- **Weave ZKPs**: Prove without revealing:
  ```typescript
  await zkpClient.submitProof(proofData, publicInputs);
  ```
- **Unleash HESMS**: Let the grid mind guard you:
  ```typescript
  const hesms = new HESMSClient(connection, wallet, greylockerClient, vaultClient, zkpClient);
  const threats = hesms.analyzePotentialThreats();
  ```

### Dashboard Uplink
- Mount `HESMSDashboard.tsx` to command the grid:
  ```tsx
  import HESMSDashboard from './components/HESMSDashboard';
  const App = () => <HESMSDashboard greylockerClient={gClient} vaultClient={vClient} zkpClient={zClient} />;
  ```
- Toggle auto-protection, simulate threats, deploy optimized configs—all from a neon-lit throne.

## The Vibe

Greylocker isn’t just tech—it’s a movement. Picture a neon-lit sprawl where GREY tokens gleam, vaults hum with encrypted secrets, and HESMS dreams in binary shadows. Every stake, every proof, every negotiation is a strike against the exposed grid of old. This is *your* fortress, *your* rebellion, *your* power. Deploy it. Command it. Own it.

*The grid bends to no one—except you.*
