# GREY Token Whitepaper

## Abstract

The **GREY token** is the cornerstone of the Greylocker ecosystem, a decentralized platform engineered to empower users with sovereignty over their digital identity and data. Deployed on Solana as an SPL token, GREY facilitates a privacy-centric economy where users monetize their data, services pay for access, and a robust system of staking and slashing ensures accountability. With features like access fee payments, staking for security and validation, and rewards for anonymized data pools, GREY redefines the data economy—placing control and profit in the hands of users, not corporations.

## 1. Introduction

In an era of pervasive surveillance and data exploitation, Greylocker emerges as a decentralized sanctuary for digital privacy. It offers users a vault to securely store sensitive data—credentials, payment details, browsing history, and biometric information—encrypted and distributed across a trustless network. Beyond storage, Greylocker creates a marketplace where privacy is a commodity, and the **GREY token** is its currency. GREY powers transactions, incentivizes participation, and enforces integrity, making privacy not just a right, but a rewarded choice.

The Greylocker ecosystem consists of three core components:
1. **Main Greylocker Program**: Manages the GREY token, staking, service providers, data pools, and governance
2. **Identity Vault Program**: Handles secure data storage with different encryption levels and sharing preferences
3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs Program**: Enables privacy-preserving verification without revealing sensitive data

These components are enhanced by the ArgOS Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory System (HESMS), which adds cognitive capabilities to the ecosystem, allowing for adaptive privacy protection, pattern recognition, and intelligent decision-making.

## 2. Token Overview

- **Name**: Greylocker Token
- **Symbol**: GREY
- **Standard**: Solana SPL Token
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 GREY (1 billion tokens)
- **Decimals**: 9
- **Blockchain**: Solana

The GREY token has a fixed maximum supply of 1 billion, with 20% (200 million GREY) minted at launch for ecosystem development. Built with best-practice security features, it includes burnable functionality, pausability for emergency situations, and role-based access control for governance.

## 3. Token Utility

GREY serves multiple roles within the Greylocker ecosystem, each tied to specific program functions:

### 3.1 Access Fees
Services (e.g., e-commerce platforms) pay users in GREY to access their data. Users dictate terms, reversing the traditional model where tech giants profit from personal data.

- **Mechanism**: Service providers must be registered and staked, transferring GREY directly to users for each data request.
- **Pricing Model**: Users set base rates for different data types, with modifiers based on duration, data sensitivity, and service provider reputation.
- **Time-Limited Access**: All access grants have expirations, after which services must pay again to maintain access.

### 3.2 Staking
GREY holders stake tokens to participate in various roles:

- **Security Staking**: Users lock GREY (minimum 100 GREY) to enhance vault security, earning 5% annual rewards.
- **Service Staking**: Providers stake 10,000 GREY to register and maintain reputation, enabling data access requests.
- **Data Validator Staking**: Validators stake 5,000 GREY to verify data pool contributions, earning 10% annually.
- **Liquidity Staking**: Providers stake 1,000 GREY to support market liquidity, earning 8% annually.

Staking includes lock periods, with penalties for early unstaking. Rewards are minted as new tokens, subject to the maximum supply cap.

### 3.3 Slashing
The slashing mechanism enforces accountability by penalizing misbehaving actors. When a service provider misuses data or violates terms, 50% of their stake can be slashed—half burned, half redistributed to the affected user—maintaining ecosystem trust.

Slashing occurs through two mechanisms:
1. **Dispute Resolution**: Users file disputes with evidence, which are evaluated by governance
2. **Automated Detection**: HESMS AI agents can detect suspicious patterns and trigger investigations

### 3.4 Data Pools
Users opt into anonymized data pools via the `joinDataPool` function, earning GREY based on contributions. Pools, managed by governance, offer configurable reward rates per data point.

Data pools enable valuable aggregated insights while preserving individual privacy:
- **Anonymization**: Individual data is processed through zero-knowledge proofs before entering pools
- **Validation**: Data validators ensure quality and honesty in contributions
- **Dynamic Rewards**: Pool rewards adjust based on data demand and scarcity

### 3.5 Governance
GREY holders influence the ecosystem through the governance system, adjusting parameters like staking minimums, reward rates, and slashing percentages. The governance framework ensures transparency and community control.

Governance power scales with both stake amount and stake duration, incentivizing long-term alignment with ecosystem health.

## 4. Token Mechanics

### 4.1 Minting and Distribution

The initial GREY distribution follows this allocation:

| Allocation | Percentage | Amount | Vesting Schedule |
|------------|------------|--------|------------------|
| Ecosystem Treasury | 20% | 200,000,000 | 10% at launch, 15% quarterly thereafter |
| Community Rewards | 25% | 250,000,000 | Released over 5 years based on participation |
| Development Fund | 15% | 150,000,000 | 2-year cliff, then 25% annually |
| Founding Team | 15% | 150,000,000 | 1-year cliff, then 25% quarterly |
| Partners & Advisors | 10% | 100,000,000 | 6-month cliff, then 25% quarterly |
| Private Sale | 10% | 100,000,000 | 3-month cliff, then 25% quarterly |
| Public Sale | 5% | 50,000,000 | 20% at TGE, 20% monthly thereafter |

Additional tokens are minted through:
- **Reward Minting**: Tokens are minted for staking and data pool rewards, capped at the maximum supply.
- **Governance Minting**: The governance authority can mint tokens for ecosystem development, also subject to the cap.

### 4.2 Staking and Rewards

Staking is a core mechanism in the Greylocker ecosystem:

- **Staking Process**: Users call the `stake` function with an amount, stake type, and lock period.
- **Reward Accrual**: Rewards accumulate in real-time, claimable via the `claimStakeRewards` function.
- **Lock Periods**: Users can choose lock periods from 30 to 365 days, with longer periods earning higher rewards.
- **Early Unstaking**: Users can unstake early with a 10% penalty, which is burned to reduce total supply.

Reward rates are as follows:
- Security Staking: 5% annually
- Data Validator Staking: 10% annually
- Liquidity Staking: 8% annually
- Service Staking: No direct rewards (benefit is ability to request data access)

### 4.3 Slashing and Penalties

The slashing mechanism is critical for maintaining trust and accountability:

- **Dispute System**: Users submit disputes with evidence, and governance resolves them.
- **Slashing Percentage**: 50% of the stake is slashed when a dispute is upheld.
- **Distribution**: Half of slashed tokens are burned, half go to the affected user.
- **Reputation Impact**: Services also suffer reputation damage, affecting future interactions.

### 4.4 Data Pool Economics

Data pools create a marketplace for anonymized insights:

- **Pool Creation**: Governance creates pools based on market demand.
- **Contribution Rewards**: Users earn GREY based on quality, uniqueness, and demand for their data.
- **Validator Rewards**: Validators earn a percentage of pool rewards for ensuring data quality.
- **Market Dynamics**: Pool rewards adjust based on supply and demand for specific data types.

### 4.5 Deflationary Mechanisms

GREY incorporates several deflationary mechanisms:

- **Token Burning**: Tokens are burned from early unstaking penalties and slashing events.
- **Capped Supply**: No more than 1 billion tokens will ever exist.
- **Decreasing Emission**: Reward rates can be adjusted downward by governance as the ecosystem matures.

These mechanisms help maintain token value as adoption grows.
