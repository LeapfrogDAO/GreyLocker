# Greylocker Solana Program Architecture Overview

Welcome to the neon-drenched underbelly of Greylocker—a Solana-powered juggernaut where privacy reigns, tokens flow, and justice cuts like a plasma blade. Built atop the blockchain’s screaming 50,000 TPS, Greylocker is more than a program; it’s a living grid of vaults, stakes, and data streams, all orchestrated through Rust’s precision and Solana’s speed. This architecture overview is your uplink to the system’s core—detailing its components, design principles, and operational flow. Jack in, and let’s decode the matrix.

## Core Components

Greylocker’s architecture is a constellation of interlocking systems, each a vital node in the privacy-first ecosystem:

### 1. GREY Token (SPL Token)
- **Purpose**: The lifeblood of Greylocker—a fungible SPL Token powering staking, access fees, and rewards.
- **Specs**: 
  - Max Supply: 1 billion GREY (1_000_000_000 * 10^9 with 9 decimals).
  - Initial Distribution: 20% minted to the treasury for ecosystem growth.
- **Mechanics**: Managed via Solana’s SPL Token program, with minting controlled by governance and burns triggered by slashing or penalties.
- **Cyberpunk Vibe**: A shimmering digital currency coursing through the grid’s veins, traded in shadowy data markets.

### 2. Vault System
- **Purpose**: Decentralized identity vaults storing user data, accessible only via GREY payments or zero-knowledge proofs (future ZKP integration).
- **Design**: Off-chain storage (e.g., IPFS) with on-chain access control, linked to `AccessRecord` accounts.
- **Future**: Planned integration with zk-SNARKs for anonymous access verification.
- **Vibe**: Impenetrable data citadels, glowing with encrypted secrets in the blockchain’s depths.

### 3. Staking Mechanism
- **Purpose**: Locks GREY tokens to secure vaults, empower services, validate data, or provide liquidity.
- **Types**:
  - **Security**: Enhances vault protection (min: 100 GREY).
  - **Service**: Enables service providers (min: 10,000 GREY).
  - **DataValidator**: Validates data pool integrity (min: 5,000 GREY).
  - **Liquidity**: Boosts ecosystem liquidity (min: 1,000 GREY).
- **Mechanics**: Tokens are locked in `StakeAccount` PDAs with reward rates (5-10% APR) and early unstake penalties (10%).
- **Vibe**: Neon-lit lockboxes pulsing with power, binding users to the grid’s defense.

### 4. Data Pools
- **Purpose**: Anonymized data-sharing hubs where users opt-in to earn GREY rewards.
- **Structure**: `DataPool` accounts define reward rates and data types (e.g., Browsing, Location), with `Participant` accounts tracking contributions.
- **Mechanics**: Governance creates pools; users join and receive rewards via `pay_data_reward`.
- **Vibe**: Glowing data streams feeding the ecosystem, a marketplace of shadows and incentives.

### 5. Dispute Resolution and Slashing
- **Purpose**: Enforces trust by penalizing bad actors with stake slashing.
- **Process**: 
  - Users file disputes (`Dispute` accounts) with evidence.
  - Governance resolves disputes, slashing up to 50% of stakes—half burned, half to the reporter.
- **Mechanics**: Tied to `StakeAccount` and `ServiceProvider` via PDAs, with slashing executed via SPL Token burns and transfers.
- **Vibe**: A digital courtroom where plasma blades of justice carve through deceit.

### 6. Governance Parameters
- **Purpose**: Dynamic controls for tuning the ecosystem’s pulse.
- **Parameters**: 
  - Stake minimums (e.g., `security_stake_minimum`).
  - Reward rates (e.g., `security_reward_rate`).
  - Slashing and penalty percentages.
- **Mechanics**: Stored in `GreylockerState`, adjustable via `update_governance_parameter` by the governance authority.
- **Vibe**: The grid’s central console, wielded by the unseen architects of power.

## Program Design

Greylocker’s design is a fusion of Solana’s stateless architecture and Anchor’s structured elegance, optimized for speed, security, and scalability:

### Core Principles
- **Stateless Execution**: Logic resides in `lib.rs`, with state stored in separate accounts (`accounts.rs`) for Solana’s parallel processing.
- **PDA-Driven**: Program-Derived Addresses ensure deterministic, trustless account management for stakes, pools, and disputes.
- **SPL Token Integration**: Leverages Solana’s SPL Token program for all minting, transferring, and burning operations.
- **Modularity**: Functions are cleanly separated by role (token management, staking, disputes), enhancing maintainability.
- **Security**: Access controls (e.g., governance-only minting) and overflow checks (e.g., `checked_add`) harden the grid.

### Architectural Flow
1. **Initialization** (`initialize`):
   - Creates the GREY mint and `GreylockerState` PDA.
   - Mints 20% of max supply to the treasury.
2. **Staking** (`stake`/`unstake`/`claim_stake_rewards`):
   - Users lock GREY in `StakeAccount` PDAs, earning rewards based on type and duration.
3. **Service Operations** (`register_service`/`pay_access_fee`):
   - Providers stake GREY, register, and pay users for data access, recorded in `ServiceProvider` and `AccessRecord`.
4. **Data Pools** (`create_data_pool`/`join_data_pool`/`pay_data_reward`):
   - Governance spawns pools; users join and earn rewards, tracked via `DataPool` and `Participant`.
5. **Disputes** (`create_dispute`/`resolve_dispute`/`slash`):
   - Disputes trigger slashing, updating stakes and reputation in `Dispute` and `ServiceProvider`.
6. **Governance** (`update_governance_parameter`/`pause`/`unpause`):
   - Tunes parameters and controls the grid’s state, restricted to authorized keys.

## Technical Breakdown

### Key Files
- **`lib.rs`**: The program’s beating heart—defines all instructions (`initialize`, `stake`, etc.) and integrates with SPL Token via CPI calls.
- **`accounts.rs`**: The grid’s skeleton—structs (`GreylockerState`, `StakeAccount`), enums (`StakeType`, `DataType`), and contexts (`Initialize`, `Stake`).

### Account Structures
- **`GreylockerState`**: Global state with token mint, treasury, and governance params (~194 bytes).
- **`StakeAccount`**: Per-user stake with type, amount, and lock period (~89 bytes).
- **`ServiceProvider`**: Service metadata and stake linkage (~398 bytes).
- **`DataPool`**: Pool config and stats (~390 bytes).
- **`Dispute`**: Dispute details with evidence (~1168 bytes).

### Enums
- **`StakeType`**: Defines staking roles (Security, Service, etc.).
- **`DataType`**: Categorizes data (Identity, Browsing, Custom).
- **`DisputeStatus`/`DisputeResolution`**: Tracks dispute lifecycle.

### Instructions
- **Token Management**: `governance_mint` for controlled issuance.
- **Staking**: `stake`, `unstake`, `claim_stake_rewards` with lock periods and rewards.
- **Service**: `register_service`, `pay_access_fee` for provider-user interactions.
- **Data Pools**: `create_data_pool`, `join_data_pool`, `pay_data_reward` for data sharing.
- **Disputes**: `create_dispute`, `resolve_dispute`, `slash` for enforcement.
- **Governance**: `update_governance_parameter`, `pause`, `unpause` for control.

### Error Handling
- Custom `GreylockerError` enum catches edge cases (e.g., `ProgramPaused`, `InsufficientStakeAmount`), ensuring robust operation.

## Design Considerations

### Scalability
- **PDAs**: Deterministic addresses scale with user growth without keypair management.
- **SPL Token**: Offloads token ops to Solana’s proven infrastructure, reducing program overhead.
- **Parallelism**: Stateless design leverages Solana’s concurrent transaction processing.

### Security
- **Access Control**: Governance-only functions (e.g., `governance_mint`) use PDA signer checks.
- **Overflow Protection**: Arithmetic ops use `checked_` methods to prevent underflows/overflows.
- **Audit Readiness**: Modular structure and clear error codes ease third-party reviews.

### Extensibility
- **ZKP Integration**: Vault system poised for zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Governance**: Parameter system supports DAO upgrades (e.g., SPL Governance).
- **HESMS**: Future cognitive AI agents can integrate via CPI calls.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Zero-Knowledge Vaults**: Add zk-SNARKs for anonymous data access, enhancing privacy.
2. **Decentralized Governance**: Replace `governance_authority` with an SPL Governance DAO.
3. **Multi-Program Architecture**: Split vault logic into a separate program for modularity.
4. **Analytics**: On-chain metrics for staking, disputes, and pool participation.
5. **Frontend Grid**: A cyberpunk UI to visualize the ecosystem’s pulse.
