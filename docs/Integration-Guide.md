# Greylocker Component Integration Guide

Jack into the neon-lit core of Greylocker—a Solana-powered fortress where privacy reigns supreme, data flows like encrypted plasma, and zero-knowledge proofs cast shadows of truth. This guide is your uplink to integrating the three pillars of the Greylocker ecosystem: the Main Greylocker Program, the Identity Vault Program, and the Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) Program. Together, they forge a comprehensive platform for data control, monetization, and anonymity, pulsing at 50,000 TPS. Strap in—we’re about to weave a grid where users wield power over their secrets, service providers pay in GREY, and AI agents guard the gates.

## System Overview

Greylocker’s architecture is a triad of Solana programs, each a vital node in a privacy-first network:

1. **Main Greylocker Program**: The grid’s beating heart—managing the GREY token, staking (Security, Service, Data Validator, Liquidity), service providers, data pools, disputes, and governance. It’s the central hub where power and profit converge.
2. **Identity Vault Program**: A citadel of encrypted data—storing user secrets with customizable encryption levels (Standard, High, Military) and sharing preferences (Never, Whitelist, Data Pool). It’s where privacy is forged into steel.
3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) Program**: The shadow weaver—enabling cryptographic proofs that verify without revealing. It issues credentials for anonymous access, turning data into whispers of truth.

Together, these programs create a seamless ecosystem where users lock their data in vaults, prove attributes with ZKPs, and trade access for GREY—all while maintaining ironclad anonymity.

## Component Interconnections

### Main Greylocker ↔ Identity Vault

The Main Greylocker Program and Identity Vault Program are bound by a neon thread of trust and transaction:

1. **Service Provider Access**:
   - **Flow**: Service providers, registered via `register_service` with a Service stake, request data access from user vaults using `pay_access_fee`. The Main program transfers GREY tokens to the user, then invokes the Vault program’s `grant_access` via CPI to record the permission.
   - **Benefit**: Users monetize their data while controlling who sees it, paid in shimmering GREY.

2. **Security Staking**:
   - **Flow**: Users staking GREY as Security in `stake` enhance their vault’s defenses. Higher stakes unlock stronger encryption (e.g., Military-grade) and data replication across IPFS or Arweave.
   - **Benefit**: Stakers become guardians of the grid, earning rewards while fortifying their vaults.

3. **Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs)**:
   - **Flow**: `pay_access_fee` triggers a CPI to `grant_access`, passing data type indices, duration, and fees. The Vault program validates the service provider’s status by querying the Main program’s `ServiceProvider` account via CPI.
   - **Benefit**: Seamless integration ensures payments and access are atomic, trustless, and secure.

### Main Greylocker ↔ ZKP

The Main Greylocker Program and ZKP Program dance in a cryptographic symbiosis:

1. **Verification for Data Pools**:
   - **Flow**: Data Validators staked via `stake` verify ZKPs submitted to `submit_proof` in the ZKP program. Successful verifications (`verify_proof`) trigger `pay_data_reward` in the Main program, rewarding validators and contributors with GREY.
   - **Benefit**: Validators secure the grid’s data streams, earning neon profits for their vigilance.

2. **Service Provider Verification**:
   - **Flow**: Service providers use ZKP credentials (from `generate_credential`) to verify user claims (e.g., “over 18”) without raw data. Verified credentials trigger `pay_access_fee`, releasing GREY to the user.
   - **Benefit**: Privacy-first access—service providers get what they need, users keep their secrets.

3. **Governance Parameters**:
   - **Flow**: The Main program’s `update_governance_parameter` can adjust ZKP settings (e.g., proof complexity) via CPI, ensuring the ecosystem evolves with governance decisions.
   - **Benefit**: A unified pulse—governance tunes both tokenomics and cryptography in sync.

### Identity Vault ↔ ZKP

The Identity Vault and ZKP Program form a shadow pact of privacy:

1. **Proof Generation**:
   - **Flow**: Data in `store_data` (e.g., birth date) is used off-chain to generate ZKPs, submitted to `submit_proof`. The ZKP program verifies these without accessing the vault.
   - **Benefit**: Users prove attributes anonymously, keeping raw data locked away.

2. **Credential-Based Access**:
   - **Flow**: Verified proofs yield credentials via `generate_credential`. Users present these to the Vault program’s `grant_access` to unlock specific data types without revealing full contents.
   - **Benefit**: Granular control—credentials act as neon keycards, opening only what’s needed.

3. **Data Verification**:
   - **Flow**: The ZKP program verifies claims (e.g., “income > $50k”) against vault data hashes, ensuring integrity without exposure.
   - **Benefit**: Trustless validation—proofs confirm truth while shadows cloak the source.

## Integration Flow Examples

### Example 1: Age Verification for Service Access
1. **Vault**: User stores ID with birth date in `initialize_vault` and `store_data`.
2. **ZKP**: User generates an “over 18” proof off-chain, submits it via `submit_proof`, and receives an `AgeCredential` from `generate_credential`.
3. **Service**: Provider requests age verification; user presents the credential via `use_credential`.
4. **Main**: Provider pays 2 GREY via `pay_access_fee`, triggering a CPI to `grant_access` for 24-hour profile access.
5. **Outcome**: Provider confirms age, user earns GREY, birth date stays hidden.

### Example 2: Anonymous Data Pool Contribution
1. **Vault**: User stores financial data in `store_data`.
2. **ZKP**: User generates a “meets criteria” proof, submits it to `submit_proof`, and gets it verified.
3. **Main**: User joins a pool with `join_data_pool`; validators confirm via `verify_proof`.
4. **Reward**: `pay_data_reward` distributes 5 GREY to the user, validated by staked Data Validators.
5. **Outcome**: User earns rewards anonymously, data stays encrypted.

### Example 3: Selective Data Sharing with Service Provider
1. **Main**: E-commerce provider stakes 10,000 GREY via `stake` and registers with `register_service`.
2. **Vault**: User stores shipping and payment data in `store_data`.
3. **ZKP**: User proves “valid shipping address” with a credential from `generate_credential`.
4. **Main**: Provider pays 5 GREY via `pay_access_fee`, invoking `grant_access` for 24-hour shipping data access.
5. **Outcome**: Provider ships goods, user profits, payment data remains locked.

## Technical Integration Details

### Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs)
CPIs are the neon conduits linking the programs. Here’s an enhanced example from the Main program:

```rust
// Main Greylocker: Pay access fee and grant vault access
pub fn pay_access_fee(ctx: Context<PayAccessFee>, amount: u64, data_type: DataType) -> Result<()> {
    // Transfer GREY tokens
    token::transfer(
        CpiContext::new(
            ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
            Transfer {
                from: ctx.accounts.service_token_account.to_account_info(),
                to: ctx.accounts.user_token_account.to_account_info(),
                authority: ctx.accounts.service_owner.to_account_info(),
            },
        ),
        amount,
    )?;

    // CPI to Identity Vault: Grant access
    let vault_program_id = Pubkey::new_from_array([/* Vault Program ID */]);
    let grant_access_ix = Instruction {
        program_id: vault_program_id,
        accounts: vec![
            AccountMeta::new(ctx.accounts.user.key(), true),
            AccountMeta::new(ctx.accounts.user_vault.key(), false),
            AccountMeta::new_readonly(ctx.accounts.service_provider.key(), false),
            AccountMeta::new(ctx.accounts.access_grant.key(), false),
            AccountMeta::new_readonly(web3::SystemProgram::program_id(), false),
        ],
        data: anchor_lang::InstructionData::data(&vault_instruction::GrantAccess {
            data_type_indices: vec![data_type_to_index(&data_type)],
            duration: 24 * 60 * 60, // 24 hours
            access_fee: amount,
        }),
    };

    invoke(
        &grant_access_ix,
        &[
            ctx.accounts.user.to_account_info(),
            ctx.accounts.user_vault.to_account_info(),
            ctx.accounts.service_provider.to_account_info(),
            ctx.accounts.access_grant.to_account_info(),
            ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info(),
        ],
    )?;

    Ok(())
}

// Helper function to convert DataType to index
fn data_type_to_index(data_type: &DataType) -> u8 {
    match data_type {
        DataType::Identity => 0,
        DataType::Payment => 1,
        // ... other mappings ...
        _ => 0, // Default or custom handling
    }
}
```

### Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
PDAs ensure deterministic, cross-program access:

1. **User Vault PDA**: `["vault", user_pubkey]`—Main and ZKP programs locate it for access and proof generation.
2. **ZKP Registry PDA**: `["zkp-registry", user_pubkey]`—Main program verifies credentials against it.
3. **Service Provider PDA**: `["service-provider", owner_pubkey]`—Vault program checks its legitimacy.

### Verification and Authentication
- **Service Provider**: Vault queries Main’s `ServiceProvider` via CPI, ensuring `stake_account` meets minimums and `reputation_score` is above threshold.
- **Proofs**: ZKP’s `verify_proof` confirms cryptographic validity; Main trusts the result for rewards or access.
- **Authority**: Ownership checks (e.g., `vault.owner == user`) and governance validation (e.g., `governance_authority`) secure all ops.

## Client Integration

Clients weave the triad into a unified interface. Here’s an enhanced flow using `GreylockerClient`:

```typescript
import { GreylockerClient, StakeType, DataType } from './utils/greylocker';

// Initialize all components
async function initializeUser(client: GreylockerClient, vaultClient: any, zkpClient: any) {
  await client.initialize(); // Main Greylocker
  await vaultClient.initializeVault('My Vault', 'Personal Data Fortress'); // Vault
  await zkpClient.initializeRegistry(); // ZKP
}

// Selective sharing example
async function shareShippingAddress(
  mainClient: GreylockerClient,
  vaultClient: any,
  zkpClient: any,
  serviceProvider: web3.PublicKey
) {
  // Store shipping data
  await vaultClient.storeData(0, encryptedShippingData, 'Shipping Address', ipfsCid);

  // Generate ZKP
  const proof = await generateOffChainProof('valid_shipping');
  const proofTx = await zkpClient.submitProof(proof.data, proof.inputs);
  await zkpClient.verifyProof(proofTx);
  const credentialTx = await zkpClient.generateCredential('ShippingCredential');

  // Pay and grant access
  await mainClient.payAccessFee(serviceProvider, 5, DataType.Location, 24);
}

// UI Integration (React example)
const GreylockerUI = () => {
  const { connection } = useConnection();
  const wallet = useWallet();
  const mainClient = new GreylockerClient(connection, wallet);
  // Similar for vaultClient, zkpClient

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => mainClient.stake(100, StakeType.Security, 30)}>
        Stake GREY
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => shareShippingAddress(mainClient, vaultClient, zkpClient, providerKey)}>
        Share Shipping
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## HESMS AI Integration

HESMS AI agents—sentinels of the grid—enhance Greylocker with cognitive power:

1. **Automated Privacy Negotiation**:
   - **Flow**: Agents monitor `pay_access_fee` offers, counter with optimal fees based on historical data, and execute via CPI.
   - **Benefit**: Maximizes user profits while minimizing exposure.

2. **Threat Detection**:
   - **Flow**: Analyzes `AccessGrant` patterns via `getAllAccessRecords`, flags anomalies, and suggests `revoke_access` or `create_dispute`.
   - **Benefit**: Proactive defense against data misuse.

3. **Smart Data Management**:
   - **Flow**: Evaluates `getAllDataPools` rewards vs. privacy risks, recommending `join_data_pool` or `store_data` adjustments.
   - **Benefit**: Optimizes user strategy in real-time.

## Deployment Strategy

Deploy the triad with precision:

1. **Deploy Programs**:
   ```bash
   anchor deploy --program-name greylocker --provider.cluster devnet
   anchor deploy --program-name greylocker_vault --provider.cluster devnet
   anchor deploy --program-name greylocker_zkp --provider.cluster devnet
   ```

2. **Initialize Integration**:
   - **Register IDs**: Update each program’s state with the others’ IDs (e.g., `GreylockerState.vault_program_id`).
   - **Set Parameters**: Use `update_governance_parameter` to sync settings (e.g., stake minimums, proof complexity).
   - **Seed ZKPs**: Pre-register common verification keys (e.g., age, location) in `register_verification_key`.

3. **Launch Client**: Deploy a unified frontend (e.g., React) with `GreylockerClient` instances for all programs.

## Conclusion

Greylocker’s triad—Main, Vault, and ZKP—forges a neon-lit ecosystem where users command their data, service providers pay for shadows, and ZKPs cloak the truth. Integrated via CPIs, PDAs, and HESMS AI, it’s a comprehensive solution for privacy-first blockchain living. This guide is your blueprint—deploy it, wield it, and let the grid’s pulse reshape the future.
